**Glorious Merchant** is a mod for ELDEN RING that provides free access to every item for quick build making.

- **Compatible with other mods without merging anything** - just install a single DLL file.
- **Accessible even if Kalé is dead** - he will be temporarily revived and non-hostile while the mod is active.
- **Auto-upgrade weapons** - weapons are upgraded to the highest level you've already attained on a given character, so no need to run back and forth between Hewg and Kalé (optional - can be disabled via config file).
- Supports all languages supported by the vanilla game. Some languages have partial English text - let me know if you'd like to contribute to or fix a localization.

Mods that add new items, such as weapons and armor in [The Convergence](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3419) and [ELDEN RING Reforged](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/541), will also have these new items available in the appropriate shop menus.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of [ModEngine2](https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2/releases/latest) and extract it somewhere.
2. Download the mod and extract `ermerchant.dll` and `ermerchant.ini` into the ModEngine-2.1.0.0-win64 folder, exactly as shown in the screenshot below.
3. Open `config_eldenring.toml` in Notepad and look for the line starting with `external_dlls`. Add `"erdyes.dll",` (punctuation included) between the brackets, exactly as shown in the screenshot below.
4. Double-click `launchmod_eldenring.bat` to start the game.

## Usage

Talk to [Merchant Kalé](https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Merchant_Kal%C3%A9) in the Church of Elleh.

Items from the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion are available under the "Browse Inventory" > "DLC Items" submenu. You can avoid this menu if you'd like to avoid spoilers or don't own the DLC.
